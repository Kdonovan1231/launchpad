When you run your IPFS node as a daemon, an HTTP RPC API is automatically exposed.
Because every CLI command is available on the API, you can use this API to programmatically operate as if you were using the IPFS CLI. Note that the IPFS API is not a REST API; all endpoints are accessible by using the HTTP POST method.

You can access the IPFS API of your local node at `http://localhost:5001/api/v0/<operation>`. Note that the `5001` port is used by default when you spin up your node.

Although accessing the API directly through HTTP requests is a valid approach, there are tools available for the two main programming languages of the IPFS ecosystem: Go (Golang) and JavaScript.

The main implementation of IPFS is https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs[Go-IPFS], which allows you to set up your node by spinning up a daemon application written in Go. At the same time, https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs[JS-IPFS] is an officially supported implementation of IPFS in JavaScript. You can take three approaches to use these implementations in your application.

* **Embedded node:** if you want your application to spin up an IPFS node, then use `Go-IPFS` or `JS-IPFS`.
* **Client:** if you already have a running IPFS node, then you can use a client written in Go or JS to communicate with the node. Use https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-api[go-ipfs-api] for Go, and https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/tree/master/packages/ipfs-http-client[js-ipfs-http-client] for JS.
* **HTTP API:** send HTTP requests directly from your Go or JS application to interact with the node.

Both `JS-IPFS` and `js-ipfs-http-client` work in the browser with some considerations noted in their READMEs.

## Exercise: Connecting to an IPFS node by using the Go client

In this exercise, you will use the Go client to interact with a running IPFS node.

By the end of the exercise, you should be able to:

* Connect to a running IPFS node.
* Add a file.
* Print the content of the file.
* Download the file to your computer.
* Add the file to IPNS.

### Prerequisites

* You must have Go installed. In this exercise, version 1.18 is used.
If you do not have Go installed, refer to [this page](https://go.dev/doc/install).
If you want to install multiple versions of Go, refer to [this page](https://go.dev/doc/manage-install#installing-multiple).
* Clone the `https://github.com/protocol/launchpad-tutorials` Git repository, which contains all the sample applications used in the Launchpad program.
* You must have an IPFS node running at the default `5001` port.
Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7yZaYhrwyM) to learn how to spin up an IPFS node.

### Instructions

* In an editor, open the `ipfs-go-client` folder of the `launchpad-tutorials` repository.

* Examine the `go.mod` file, which contains the dependencies of the application.
Note that the `github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-api` is set as a dependency, and the rest of dependencies are _indirect_. To read more about indirect dependencies in Go, refer to [this page](https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-mod-file-require).

* Open the `main.go` file, which contains the code for this exercise.
Notice that there are several not implemented methods, which you will complete throughout the exercise.

* Review the `func main()` function, which is the entry point of the application. This function calls the different functions that you will implement and handles their result for you.
For example, the following snippet calls the `addFile` method. If an error is returned, then the program is terminated with the error message; if no error occurs, then the CID of the file is printed.

```go
// 1. Add the "Hello from Launchpad!" text to IPFS
fmt.Println("Adding file to IPFS")
cid, err := addFile(sh, "Hello from Launchpad!")
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println("Error adding file to IPFS:", err.Error())
	return
}
fmt.Println("File added with CID:", cid)
```

* A connection to the node is created by providing the location of the node's API.

```go
sh := shell.NewShell("localhost:5001")
```

The `NewShell` method returns a `*shell.Shell` object that exposes all the available methods to interact with the IPFS node.

* Add a file that contains the `Hello from Launchpad!` text to IPFS by using the `Add` method.

```go
func addFile(sh *shell.Shell, text string) (string, error) {
    return sh.Add(strings.NewReader(text))
}
```

The `Add` method expects a reader, which can be generated from reading a local file or providing a string.
If no errors have occurred, the CID of the added file is returned.

* Read the content of the file by using the `Cat` method.

```go
func readFile(sh *shell.Shell, cid string) (*string, error) {
    reader, err := sh.Cat(fmt.Sprintf("/ipfs/%s", cid))
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("Error reading the file: %s", err.Error())
    }

    bytes, err := io.ReadAll(reader)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("Error reading bytes: %s", err.Error())
    }

    text := string(bytes)

    return &text, nil
}
```

An IPFS canonical path is passed to the `Cat` method by including the CID of the file. You can read more about canonical paths [here](https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/address-ipfs-on-web/#turning-native-address-to-a-canonical-content-path).

The `Cat` method returns a reader, so the `io.ReadAll` helper function is used to get the bytes of the file. Then, the bytes are cast into a string.

* Download the file to your computer by using the `Get` method.

```go
func downloadFile(sh *shell.Shell, cid string) error {
    return sh.Get(cid, YourLocalPath)
}
```

The `Get` method expects two parameters: the CID of the file and the local path of your computer where the file will be downloaded.
`YourLocalPath` is a constant defined at the beginning of the `main.go` file, so include there the local path where the file will be downloaded.

* To publish your file to IPNS, you will need a public key.
By default, when you install a local IPFS node, a public/private key pair called `self` is created. List your IPFS keys.

```shell
> ipfs key list -l
YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY      self
```

If you have not created any other key pair, only the `self` keypair should be listed.
Copy the public key, which starts with `k...`, as you will need it to publish the file to IPNS.

* The `main.go` file defines a `YourPublicKey` constant at the beginning.
Include your public key in the constant.

```go
const YourPublicKey = "k..."
```

* Publish the file to IPNS by using the `PublishWithDetails` method.

```go
func addToIPNS(sh *shell.Shell, cid string) error {
    var lifetime time.Duration = 50 * time.Hour
    var ttl time.Duration = 0 * time.Microsecond

    _, err := sh.PublishWithDetails(cid, YourPublicKey, lifetime, ttl, true)
    return err
}
```

The `PublishWithDetails` method expects several parameters:

1. `cid`: the CID of the file that will be published to IPNS.
2. `key`: the public key that will be used to publish the file.
In the previous snippet, the public key constant is provided.
3. `lifetime`: the time that the IPNS record will be valid.
Basically, how long IPNS will keep the mapping relationship `public key --> CID`.
By default, 24 hours.
4. `ttl`: how long IPNS will cache the record.
5. `resolve`: check if the given path can be resolved before publishing.
By default, `true`.

In the previous snippet, the record is kept in IPNS for 50 hours and there is no cache.

* Use your public key to query IPNS. The result will be the CID of the file that you published.

```go
func resolveIPNS(sh *shell.Shell) (string, error) {
    return sh.Resolve(YourPublicKey)
}
```

* Verify that everything works together by running the Go application.

```shell
> go run .
Adding file to IPFS
File added with CID: QmNsA8eUBSbpdCVHMLa8Py5TcNoZ1D9U5GkginqktrqNF1

...output omitted...

IPNS is pointing to: /ipfs/QmNsA8eUBSbpdCVHMLa8Py5TcNoZ1D9U5GkginqktrqNF1
