### The Basics
In these tutorials you can get started with installing go-ipfs (also known as kubo), and doing some basic things with the filesystems.

#### Getting Started with IPFS
This video is the basic setup for ipfs-go on a [linux VM](https://multipass.run/), using [wget](https://www.tecmint.com/install-wget-in-linux/) to grab the resources. You will also `ipfs init` a node and get it running with `ipfs daemon`.
